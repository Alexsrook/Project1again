<p>Dr. Kwame Nkrumah is hailed as one of the world's most prominent African leaders.
  On March 6th 1957, he led Ghana to gain independence from its British colonial master.

<p> Most of us do not know much about crocodiles as they either scare us or we do not want to meet them. But this sanctuary is made for hosting the crocodiles and the enthusiasts can see many of them over here.
  The crocodiles residing over here are actually very friendly towards humans that visit them. Tourists can feed the crocodiles and get up close and personal with them.
  This place respects and honors their crocodiles and is against hurting any of them.
  Guides are always present to break tourists unnecessary fear of crocodiles.
  A great place to visit if you wish to try something exciting!
